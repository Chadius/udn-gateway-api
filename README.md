# UDN Gateway API

## Introduction

The example includes a Jupyterhub notebook written using Python 2.7.10.  This notebook describes the UDN Gateway API. It also provides examples that show responses to test requests using the API endpoints.

The UDN Gateway API enables programmatic access to UDN Gateway data through token authentication. The examples shown in this guide can be executed through the command line interface (CLI) or scripted into larger functional applications. Methods that allow creation (POST), retrieval (GET), or update (PUT) are available for most patient centered models including patient applications, patient application reviews, patient records, patient consents, patient follow-up records, Phenotips data, and sequencing requests and results files. Access to the data is defined by user permissions that match those for the UDN Gateway website. If you have questions or need help with any of the examples in this guide, please contact the UDN Gateway CC.
